			<p>
				What ever your style or level of surfing is Casa Almendra has it.
				We are located directly in front of the barreling beach breaks of Colorados, with many peaks and A frames. Just up the beach is Panga Drops that breaks on a horse-shoe shaped rock reef. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We are short walk away from the community beach club that has a pool, bar, volley ball and a restaurant. You will also find the commercial center here were you will several restaurants and shops.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can experience true Nicaraguan country living by taking a local country by taking a local cultural tour. Take a horse back ride through the jungle or to one of the oldest farms in Wiscoyol. You can rent motorcycles, scooters and bikes. Boat trips are also offered in pangas (a local fisihing boat).
